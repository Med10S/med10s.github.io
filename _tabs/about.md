Hello,

I'm Mohammed Sbihi, a passionate individual obsessed with cybersecurity. Currently in my 4th year of engineering studies at ENSAF, I am dedicated to honing my skills in the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity. My journey involves exploring platforms like TryHackMe, Hack The Box, and participating in challenges like picoCTF to enhance my expertise.

Simultaneously, I wear the hat of a junior Android application developer, proficient in Java for native development and Flutter for cross-platform applications. Combining my cybersecurity knowledge with my development skills, I strive to create secure and robust mobile applications.

Feel free to explore my portfolio to learn more about my projects and the exciting world where cybersecurity and mobile development intersect.

Let's connect and explore the possibilities at the intersection of cybersecurity and cutting-edge technology!
